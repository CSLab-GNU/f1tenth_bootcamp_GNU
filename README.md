# f1tenth_rl
 f1tenth with reinforcement learning 

## Requirements
* Python 3.8
* Pip 22.0.8
* Pytorch (no need of cuda, works well with version 1.13.1)
* anaconda is an easy way to use pytorch 

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CML-KU/f1tenth_rl.git --config core.autocrlf=input
cd f1tenth_rl
pip install --user -e gym
```

# Main
main at pkg/src/pkg folder
